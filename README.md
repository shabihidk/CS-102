# CS-102: My C++ Learning Scratchpad 💡

This repository contains a **raw, unfiltered collection of C++ exercises and code snippets** I wrote while learning C++ in CS-102 at GIKI. It's not a roadmap — just a bunch of random practice tasks, experiments, and small programs that helped me grasp different programming concepts.

---

## 🎯 Why I Made This

- To **learn by doing** — trying things out instead of just reading
- To store every experiment, mistake, and mini success
- To give others a peek into what early C++ practice might look like
- To share how the **thinking** behind code develops over time

---

## 📦 What You’ll Find

- 🧠 Concept-based snippets: functions, loops, arrays, OOP
- 🧪 Experimentation with edge cases and logic
- 💥 Some broken code, some working solutions — all part of the process
- 🚧 Unorganized files that show real learning, not curated perfection

---

## 🧑‍💻 Who Should Peek Inside

- Beginners wondering: *“What should I practice while learning C++?”*
- Curious coders interested in **learning from someone else’s messy but honest journey**
- Anyone who wants to see **how code evolves with practice**


> This repo isn’t perfect — and that’s the point.  
> It’s just me figuring stuff out, one bug at a time.
